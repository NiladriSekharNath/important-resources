## Introduction ## 

## Tell me about yourself ## 

**"Hi, my name is Niladri, and I am a Software Engineer with over five years of experience in backend development, 
specializing in Java, Spring Boot, and microservices. I am currently part of the Digital Personalization team at Adidas,
where I focus on building scalable backend services that power features like 'You May Also Like' (YMAL) 
and 'Others Also Bought' (OAB) on Adidas.com and the mobile app. While the Data Science team generates ranked
recommendations using machine learning models—training them on user interactions, searches, and clicks—our team 
ensures these recommendations are efficiently processed, optimized, and served via the Personalization API.
We handle ingestion from S3, and store the recommendations in a regionally distributed 
DynamoDB setup for fast retrieval across different countries.

Previously, I was part of the Digital Asset Distribution team, working on optimizing how product images and videos are
displayed on product pages. One of my key contributions was developing a token-based access control feature, 
allowing early access to certain product images before their official launch. This was enabled through 
Cloudinary, a CDN tool, to dynamically control image visibility based on predefined tokens.

Overall, I enjoy designing and optimizing backend services that enhance user experiences and improve system performance. 
I’m excited to discuss how my expertise can contribute to your team!"**
