# **WebSocket vs WebRTC**
---

## **What is WebSocket?**
- **Protocol:** Works over TCP. 
- **Purpose:** Persistent, bidirectional communication between a client and server.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Real-time updates like stock prices, chat applications, and notifications, collaborative environments like Google docs.
  - Sending reliable, ordered data over a stable connection.
- **How It Works:**
  - Starts as an HTTP connection.
  - Upgraded to WebSocket when the client sends a special header (`Upgrade: websocket`).

## **What is WebRTC?**
- **Protocol:** Primarily uses UDP for peer-to-peer communication.
- **Purpose:** Real-time communication with minimal latency.
- **Use Cases:**
  - Video conferencing (e.g., Google Meet, Zoom).
  - Peer-to-peer multiplayer games or file sharing.
- **How It Works:**
  - Establishes a direct peer-to-peer connection (bypassing the server where possible).
  - Uses protocols like ICE, STUN, and TURN to handle NAT traversal.

## **Comparison of WebSocket and WebRTC**
| **Feature**         | **WebSocket**                           | **WebRTC**                            |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **Protocol**         | TCP                                    | UDP                                    |
| **Communication**    | Client ↔ Server                       | Peer ↔ Peer                           |
| **Data Type**        | Any data (text or binary)              | Media streams + data channels         |
| **Reliability**      | Reliable                               | May be unreliable (depends on mode)   |
| **Use Case Examples**| Chat, stock tickers, leaderboards      | Video/audio calls, real-time gaming   |

## **When to Use Each?**
### **WebSocket:**
- Reliable communication with a server.
- Scenarios where message ordering and delivery are critical.
- Example: Leaderboards or match results in a gaming application.

### **WebRTC:**
- Direct peer-to-peer communication to reduce latency.
- Scenarios where speed is critical, and occasional data loss is acceptable.
- Example: Real-time position updates in a multiplayer game.

---

## **Hybrid Use Case: Gaming Application**
### **Why Use Both?**
- **WebRTC:** For real-time, latency-sensitive updates like player positions.
- **WebSocket:** For reliable server-client updates like match results or leaderboards.

By using both technologies together, you can create a **responsive** and **real-time** system tailored to different types of communication needs.
