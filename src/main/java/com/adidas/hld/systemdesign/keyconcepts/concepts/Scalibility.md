# System Design: What is Scalability?

## 1. Understanding Scalability

Scalability is the property of a system to handle a growing amount of load by adding resources to the system. A truly scalable system can continuously evolve to support increasing workloads without significant performance degradation.

In this guide, we’ll explore various dimensions in which a system can grow and the most common techniques for making systems scalable.

## How Can a System Grow?

1. **Growth in User Base**
    - More users join the platform, increasing the number of requests.
    - **Example:** A social media platform experiencing a surge in new users.

2. **Growth in Features**
    - New features are introduced, expanding the system’s capabilities.
    - **Example:** An e-commerce site adding new payment methods.

3. **Growth in Data Volume**
    - User activity and logging generate ever-increasing data.
    - **Example:** A video streaming service like YouTube storing more videos over time.

4. **Growth in Complexity**
    - The architecture evolves with more components and dependencies.
    - **Example:** A simple app evolving into multiple independent microservices.

5. **Growth in Geographic Reach**
    - Expanding to serve users in new regions or countries.
    - **Example:** An e-commerce platform launching in international markets.

## How to Scale a System?

Let’s dive into 10 common techniques to achieve scalability:

1. **Vertical Scaling (Scale Up)**
    - Add more resources to existing servers (e.g., RAM, CPU, storage).
    - **Pros:** Simple to implement.
    - **Cons:** Limited by hardware capacity.

2. **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out)**
    - Add more servers to distribute the workload.
    - **Example:** Netflix adds servers to handle growing streaming demand.

3. **Load Balancing**
    - Distribute traffic across multiple servers to prevent bottlenecks.
    - **Example:** Google uses load balancing to handle global search queries.

4. **Caching**
    - Store frequently accessed data in-memory to reduce load on servers.
    - **Example:** Reddit caches hot posts to serve them quickly without hitting the database.

5. **Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)**
    - Cache static assets on globally distributed servers to reduce latency.
    - **Example:** Cloudflare uses CDNs to speed up website access worldwide.

6. **Sharding/Partitioning**
    - Split data across multiple servers to avoid bottlenecks.
    - **Example:** Amazon DynamoDB partitions data to ensure fast and scalable performance.

7. **Asynchronous Communication**
    - Handle long-running tasks in the background via message queues.
    - **Example:** Slack processes messages asynchronously, keeping the UI responsive.

8. **Microservices Architecture**
    - Break the system into smaller, independently scalable services.
    - **Example:** Uber splits services like billing, notifications, and ride matching.

9. **Auto-Scaling**
    - Automatically add or remove servers based on current traffic.
    - **Example:** AWS Auto Scaling adjusts capacity to maintain performance and minimize costs.

10. **Multi-region Deployment**
- Deploy services in multiple locations to reduce latency and improve redundancy.
- **Example:** Spotify uses multi-region deployments to ensure high availability for global users.
