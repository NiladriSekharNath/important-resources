/**
 * This algorithm combines the Fixed Window Counter and Sliding Window Log approaches for a more accurate and efficient solution.
 *
 * Instead of keeping track of every single requestâ€™s timestamp as the sliding log does,
 * it focus on the number of requests from the last window.
 *
 * So, if you are in 75% of the current window, 25% of the weight would come from the previous window, and the rest from the current one:
 *
 * weight = (100 - 75)% * lastWindowRequests + currentWindowRequests
 *
 * Now, when a new request comes, you add one to that weight (weight + 1). If this new total crosses our set limit,
 * we have to reject the request.
 *
 * How it works:
 * Keep track of request count for the current and previous window.
 *
 * Calculate the weighted sum of requests based on the overlap with the sliding window.
 *
 * If the weighted sum is less than the limit, allow the request.
 *
 *
 * Pros:
 *
 * More accurate than Fixed Window Counter.
 *
 * More memory-efficient than Sliding Window Log.
 *
 * Smooths out edges between windows.
 *
 * Cons:
 * Slightly more complex to implement.

     * (windowSizeInSeconds - timePassedInWindow) / windowSizeInSeconds: This fraction tells you how much of the

     * For example, if 10 seconds have passed in a 60-second window, 50/60 of the previous count is still relevant.
     * Multiplying this fraction by previousWindowCount: It scales the previous count down based on the
     * fraction of time remaining in the current window.

     *  Example Setup:
     *
     * Window size: 60 seconds
     * Max requests: 3
     * Previous window requests: 3
     * Current window requests: 2
     * Current window start: 100
