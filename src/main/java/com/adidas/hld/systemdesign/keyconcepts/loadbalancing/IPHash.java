/**
 *
 Calculates a hash value from the clientâ€™s IP address and uses it to determine the server to route the request.

 When to Use:
 When you need session persistence, as requests from the same client are always directed to the same server.

 Benefits:
 Simple to implement.

 Useful for applications that require sticky sessions.

 Drawbacks:
 Can lead to uneven load distribution if certain IP addresses generate more traffic than others.

 Lacks flexibility if a server goes down, as the hash mapping may need to be reconfigured.
