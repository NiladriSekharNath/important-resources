/**
 * You are given an array 'arr' of size 'n' containing positive integers and a target sum 'k'.
 *
 *
 *
 * Find the number of ways of selecting the elements from the array such that the sum of chosen elements is equal to the target 'k'.
 *
 *
 *
 * Since the number of ways can be very large, print it modulo 10 ^ 9 + 7.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: 'arr' = [1, 1, 4, 5]
 *
 * Output: 3
 *
 * Explanation: The possible ways are:
 * [1, 4]
 * [1, 4]
 * [5]
 * Hence the output will be 3. Please note that both 1 present in 'arr' are treated differently.
 * Detailed explanation ( Input/output format, Notes, Images )
 * Sample Input 1 :
 * 4 5
 * 1 4 4 5
 *
 *
 * Sample Output 1 :
 *  3
 *
 *
 * Explanation For Sample Output 1:
 * The possible ways are:
 * [1, 4]
 * [1, 4]
 * [5]
 * Hence the output will be 3. Please note that both 1 present in 'arr' are treated differently.
 *
 *
 * Sample Input 2 :
 * 3 2
 * 1 1 1
 *
 *
 * Sample Output 2 :
 * 3
 *
 *
 * Explanation For Sample Output 1:
 * There are three 1 present in the array. Answer is the number of ways to choose any two of them.
 *
 *
 * Sample Input 3 :
 * 3 40
 * 2 34 5
 *
 *
 * Sample Output 3 :
 * 0
 *
 *
 * Expected time complexity :
 * The expected time complexity is O('n' * 'k').
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 * 1 <= 'n' <= 100
 * 0 <= 'arr[i]' <= 1000
 * 1 <= 'k' <= 1000
 *
 * Time limit: 1 sec

     *
     * Why n + 1 Rows Are Needed:
     * Base Case Requires an Extra Row:
     *
     * When implementing a bottom-up DP approach, the dp[row][col] value for a given row depends on the next row (dp[row + 1][col]), since we calculate solutions by "working backwards" from the last row (n-1) to the first row (0).
     * For the last row (row = n - 1), its computation will rely on dp[n][col] â€” which corresponds to having "no elements left" (the base case).
     * Therefore, we add an extra row (row = n) to handle the base case where no elements remain. This ensures that the algorithm doesn't run into an "out of bounds" error when accessing dp[row + 1][...].
     * Interpretation of dp[n][col]:
     *
     * dp[n][col] represents the scenario where no elements are left to pick from.
     * According to the problem:
     * If col == 0 (target is 0), there is exactly 1 way to achieve this (pick no elements).
     * If col > 0 (non-zero target), there are 0 ways to achieve this because there are no elements to pick.
     * This logic is initialized explicitly as:
     *
     * for (int col = 1; col <= target; col++) {
     *     dp[n][col] = 0; // No way to form a positive target with no elements
     * }
     *
     *

    /**
     * we have initialized this as we can see the base case

     *       if(k == 0) return 1 ;
     *       return 0;
     *     }
     *
     *     so at dp[n][0] = 1
     *
     * cI >= n, dp[n] and k == 0 we marked 1
     *
     * Also after that we start the target from 0 instead of 1 in the SubsetSumEqualToK question the reason being
     * here if we see this
     *
     * target in the top down appraoch moves from
     *
     * target - nums[k] ... 0
     *
     * so in the bottoms up approach the target moves from  0 - target (reverse manner),
     * ideally for the previous question this should have been the case we should have taken that order for that question
     * as well (SubsetSumEqualToK) as well now,

     * we might have to adjust if we are taking the next col or something in future but this is crucial we build from the base
