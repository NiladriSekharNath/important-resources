/**
 * Problem statement
 You have been given an array 'PRICES' consisting of 'N' integers where PRICES[i] denotes the price of a given stock on
 the i-th day. You are also given an integer 'K' denoting the number of possible transactions you can make.

 Your task is to find the maximum profit in at most K transactions. A valid transaction involves buying a stock and then selling it.

 Note
 You canâ€™t engage in multiple transactions simultaneously, i.e. you must sell the stock before rebuying it.
 For Example
 Input: N = 6 , PRICES = [3, 2, 6, 5, 0, 3] and K = 2.
 Output: 7

 Explanation : The optimal way to get maximum profit is to buy the stock on day 2(price = 2)
 and sell it on day 3(price = 6) and rebuy it on day 5(price = 0) and sell it on day 6(price = 3).
 The maximum profit will be (6 - 2) + (3 - 0) = 7.

 Constraints
 1 <= T <= 100
 1 <= N <= 5000
 0 <= K <= N/2
 0 <= ARR[i] <=10^5

 Explanation for Sample 1
 Test Case 1: In this case, we can make a maximum of 2 transactions. The optimal way to get maximum profit
 is to make only 1 transaction, i.e., buy the stock on day 3 (price = 1) and sell it on day 5(price = 10).
 The profit will be 10 - 1 = 9.

 Test Case 2: In the second test case, we can make a maximum of 2 transactions.
 The optimal way to get maximum profit is to make 0 transactions because the price of stock
 is continuously decreasing and we will have a loss if we buy and sell the stock.

 *
 * Same logic as all the question we are allowed to buy only when we are not holding a stock otherwise we can only sell
 * if we are holding a stock
 *
 * everything same as per the question BestTimeToBuyAndSellStockIII however the only difference to this is we are allowed
 * upto k transactions
 *
 * so instead of k = 0 return 0, initially calling from 2, we change that to k = 0 return 0 calling the function k
